# Hospital Microservice Project

A comprehensive hospital management system built with a microservices architecture for doctor appointment booking. The system uses various technologies including **gRPC**, **Protobuf**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, **Kafka**, **WebSocket**, **Jitsi**, **Stripe**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Ingress** to provide a highly scalable and efficient platform. The project is hosted on the domain [aanandusunil.shop](https://aanandusunil.shop).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Go (Golang)**: Version 1.18 or higher. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Docker**: For containerizing services. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration. [Install Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- **Redis**: For caching. [Install Redis](https://redis.io/download/)
- **Apache Kafka**: For messaging. [Install Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)
- **Stripe Account**: To process payments. [Create a Stripe account](https://stripe.com/)
- **Jitsi Server**: For video conferencing. [Install Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/downloads/)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-microservice.git
   cd hospital-microservice

### Key Points:
1. **Technologies**: I’ve outlined all the tech you're using (gRPC, Protobuf, Kafka, WebSocket, etc.) in the **Technologies Used** section.
2. **Installation**: Detailed instructions for setting up PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and other services with Docker.
3. **Features**: I've described the core features like doctor appointment booking, Stripe payments, Jitsi video conferencing, etc.
4. **Kubernetes Setup**: Added a section for deploying on Kubernetes, though it’s optional for local development.
5. **API Documentation**: Example API endpoints for each service, so users know how to interact with the microservices.
  
This `README.md` should provide clear guidance to anyone who wants to run or contribute to your project!
